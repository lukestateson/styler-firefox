# Styler
Styler firefox extension to quickly add custom CSS/JavaScript code to any web page.

Add custom CSS/JavaScript code with 1-click to any web page. Open Source, free, without bloat, ads, tracking and telemetry.

Why I've made it? Because all of the Addons I've used so far are bloated, ugly and some of them have privacy issues.

It's fast and minimal, you can see the CSS edits live and also click "Run" to run JavaScript code you've written.

How to install and use:

1. Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styler-pro/
2. Click "Add to Firefox"
4. Open the website you wish to add custom styles to
4. Click on "S" icon appeared in top right corner
5. Write some CSS code (use !important if needed)
6. Spice it up with JavaScript or jQuery code
7. That's it, styles and custom code will be applied every visit
